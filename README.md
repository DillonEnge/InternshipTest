## Instructions

* Each clock contains one button which upon press with stop the other clock and start the clock selected.
* Both clocks are linked to one reset button which resets both clocks to the initial time allocated.
* Upon running out of time on a clock, the opposing player will be alerted that they have won, and the game will reset.
## Necessary Information
The clock on the left pertains to player 1, and the clock on the right pertains to player 2.

I was not sure exaclty what to do graphically because there was no graphical guidlines, so I have chosen to employ a simplistic yet effective GUI allowing a logical connection to be established on the purpose of each button, mixed with a robust, efficient javascript backing stored in a seperate file and referenced in the index from a <script> tag.
